Basically what this is, is a sentimental analysis of 500 amazon reviews (Courtesy: Kaggle) using both the VADER and the RoBERTa model and a basic comparison between them.

(Spoiler Alert): The RoBERTA model works significantly better due to the deep neural networks weights used (while using Twitter (err now X) tweets as a model) as opposed to the 
VADER model that just looks at a word and assigns some value to it depending on its positive or negative connotation.

Woohoo Comp Sci!
